> Unofficial elegant WhatsApp desktop app.

Hermes's focus is to provide stable open source WhatsApp desktop client for everyone. This project is havealy inspired by [Sindre Sorhus'](http://sindresorhus.com) [Caprine](https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine), awesome Facebook Messenger desktop app. Also a lot of code from Caprine is used in Hermes since both messengers are web based and a lot of code can be reused here.

## Install

Currently you can install Hermes only by building it yourself. As soon as it becomes more stable and usable, I'll start publishing AppImage for Linux. Support for other platforms is not currently in my plan but feel free to contribute.
